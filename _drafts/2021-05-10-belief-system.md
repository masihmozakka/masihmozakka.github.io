Ok so I was recently asked a question, which went like this; _if we make an A.I. so close to human thought and emotions to the point that it behaved exactly like a human would, would respond to stimuli in the same way as humans do, then is it ethical to torture it if one so desired?_

I would recommend pausing here and formulating your own answer, because its a bit deeper and greyscale than it may first seem. I am going to demonstrate my own train of thought and hopefully show what I believe in in the process. Lets crack on then.

So, the first thing that comes to my mind is that what do we consider sentient? Cause it will matter a great deal if the "computer" sitting infront of us was truly classified as human, right? At least to me it does. Why? Because I believe in a version of Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics that I made for humans:

- A human may not injure another human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

- A human must always act with compassion towards others, knowledge and protection of the environment except where the realization of such pursuits would conflict with the First Law.

- A human must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Now, I know that there are many loopholes in such directive frameworks like Azimov's, and that one can formulate cases that would make a robot perform counter intuitive actions. But humans are smart and they have their big brains, so I tag along a "zeroth" law to these three (and for the sake of parody lets call them The Three Laws of Homodynamics) which goes like:

- A human must always rely on their accumulated knowledge and make the most rational decision based on the circumstance whilst also following the other three rules.

Again, I reiterate that even with the addition of this zeroth rule one may be able to break them, but thats a discussion for another post. Now, you might also ask _why do we even need compassion? does it even matter?_
Well, I would say it does. Because another pillar of my belief system is that even though we will eventually fizzle out of existance and face the inevitable reign of death, why not be the best we can? I mean, you say that it doesn't matter in the end, so why not create a more positive atmosphere around youself before you go? Some might say this is "freedom", and that we are free to do what we please.
