As of today, there are exactly 99 weeks left until september 4th, 2023. The day that I turn 23 years old, and the day that I would've most likely begun my master's degree somewhere far away from my current residence. Far away from most friends and almost certainly all of my family.

The thought of leaving everything behind scares me, as it does most people. But it also brings out a feeling of curiousity in me and makes me wonder about all of the new opportunities that I will have. To give myself more purpose and help my mind work through all of the emotions that I will have during this journey, I want to write a Japanese Haiku for every week that I have until that date. I hope that you, the reader, enjoy following me as I explore my future while it slowly unfolds.

To begin, Haiku for the first week:

<em>As the seasons change,</em> <br>
<em>My emotions change so too.</em> <br>
<em>Like flowing water</em> <br>
