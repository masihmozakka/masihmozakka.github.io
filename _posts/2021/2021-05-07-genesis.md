If you're seeing this it means that my blog is up and running, and everything is working perfectly (phew!).
This blog is meant as a place where I can talk about everything I love,
from Mathematics to Computer Science and onto topics in Engineering. I also plan on letting my hair down a little bit and talk about my daily experiences here. Kinda like a very high maintenance (and limited traffic) journal.\\
Since this is the first ever post on my blog, I guess I should start with
(in my opinion) the greatest mathematical formula there ever was and will be; linking the most fundamental concepts of mathematics and a source of continuous wonder, the Euler Identity:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0.$$

Let there be light!
