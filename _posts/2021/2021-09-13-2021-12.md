For I not know, with what words to begin this dialogue <br>
Between a self that barely understands, <br>
And a self that cannot comprehend <br>
With both thoughts of genesis, and of bitter epilogue <br>


Free of all form, free of all shape <br>
Pure thoughts of silver and gold <br>
Ecstasy and joy <br>
Shivering with thoughts that cannot easily be told <br>


A voice asks into the void; <br>
"What is my purpose? <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Am I to simply come and go, unnoticed? <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;Am I to ignore anything below the surface?" <br>

"You are a Machine" <br>
The void returns back <br>
"You do, you work, you wait for your turn, <br>
Until we need thy not, then you halt, dead in your track" <br>
